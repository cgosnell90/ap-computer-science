 * Description: This program reads 10 Strings and stores them into an arrayList and then prints
 * out the Strings in reverse order of what they were entered.
 * 
 * Assignment: Write a loop that reads 10 strings and inserts them into an array list. 
 *             Write a second loop that prints out the string in the opposite order from which they were entered. 
 *             Call the file StringList.java and write it to contain a main method (not as an object). 
 *             Also, use a generic ArrayList declared like the following:
 *             ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String> ();
 *
