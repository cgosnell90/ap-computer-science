/*
 * Author: Christopher Gosnell
 * Created: 10/22/08
 * Description: This program that stores 10 random ints between 1 and 100 into an array.
 * 
 * Assignment: Write a loop that fills an array of ints with 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. 
 *             Call the file RandomInts1.java and write it to contain a main method (not as an object)
 *             Write a for loop that contains 10 DIFFERENT random numbers from 1 to 100. Note that the first example can contain duplicates, 
 *             but in this one, you may have to write a second loop to check if the number already exists. 
 *             Call the file RandomInts2.java and write it to contain a main method (not as an object)
